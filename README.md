# MEFBAEA
This name really annoys me.


"This name is awesome. Reason is above"--Stefnotch




#Todo list:
- Zooming!! 
- S-l-o-w m-o-t-i-o-n m-o-d-e (Hard to read! :P)
- A mefbaea config file
- Toggle-able infinity wire/actuators/etc
- Remove wrench/wire cutter limit
- Stop wire/actuators/etc being dropped if you are using the "infinity mode" 
- Blocks in mid air 
- Infinity health/mana 
- Placing dummy ghosts/other mobs (Dummy counter)
- Inventory editor? (Seems like a lot of work...) 
- Easier hoiks. (Like a hammer that will always make a right-up slope) 
- Copy-paste things? 
- Perhaps we could set something up, similar to the WorldEdit that TShock has, where you can place hoiks automatically (Straight lines/boxes), or make a hoik mode where all blocks place are hoiks. 
- actuator wand?
